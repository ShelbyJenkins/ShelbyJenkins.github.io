  <summary><h1> Why </h1></summary>

  - **No Paywalls and Walled Gardens.**
    - Blogging platforms like Medium put your posts behind a paywall. Others like Substack and Dev.to might someday do the same.
    - Linkedin and other social media are in the business of controlling your content. It can make organic discovery of your content via SEO difficult or impossible.
- **Github and Git is pretty great!** 
    - Git gives you a higher level of version control (saving), remote editing, and redudancy. 
    - You maintain complete control of your work to share, edit, or export for other platforms.
    - Github Pages are free (for now), but because it's built on Git you can export to another provider easily.
- **It's more professional.**
    - A Github Page is considered *safe* to click on as a common, well known, non-paywalled service.
    - It may impress non-technical people to say you built your own site.
    - You can use your own domain name and your own styling to really create something unique.
- **It's fun!**
    - If you are comfortable with not understanding *everything*, it's an enjoyable experience to create and learn.
    - It's actually really easy (30m-60m).

  <summary><h1> Setup </h1></summary>

  - **First Steps**
    - You will need a *fancy* text editor called '[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)'. It's not just for coders!
    - If you're very new to this, I'd suggest asking any questions you have to ChatGPT. It's very good at giving step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
    - You will also need [NPM.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)

*It should also be possible to use a Github Codespace. In the future I may write instructions for this which will simplify things.*

        ```sh
